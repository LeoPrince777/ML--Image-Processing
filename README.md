Problem Statement: 
Dataset Generation of Synthetic ID Card Samples with Varied Text and Backgrounds

Background:
At Hyperverge, we frequently encounter situations where client requirements necessitate the use of limited data due to compliance or other constraints. However, the effectiveness of our AI models heavily relies on a diverse dataset. Additionally, it’s crucial to validate our models’ performance across a wide range of variations, including different lighting conditions, slight blurring, and inverted images.

Objective:
To address these challenges, we aim to generate a dataset comprising 100 synthetic ID card samples. Rather than basic image augmentation techniques, we want you to use the given card as a template and generate new samples with new information like name, id numbers etc.


Instructions:
Utilize the provided ID card image as a template.
Generate 100 unique ID card samples by incorporating diverse text content and background designs.
We provided a tight crop of the image but almost no one clicks a picture like that, please add some realistic background to the generated images.
Explore innovative methods and approaches to produce realistic variations that can effectively validate our model’s performance.
Experiment with different text styles, fonts, sizes, and orientations.
Consider incorporating various background patterns, colors, and gradients to create visually distinct samples.
Aim to simulate real-world scenarios while ensuring the authenticity and usability of the generated ID cards.
